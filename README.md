# Public Health & Healthcare Analytics Portfolio

A curated portfolio of applied public health and healthcare analytics projects developed using **SAS, R, and SQL**.  
The work emphasizes **infectious disease surveillance, epidemiologic analysis, data cleaning, statistical modeling, and dashboard-ready insights**, using real-world public health and healthcare datasets.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Breastfeeding & Antenatal Nutritional Counseling (SAS)
- **Focus:** Early initiation of breastfeeding in Ethiopia using DHS data  
- **Methods & Tools:** SAS (PROC SURVEYFREQ, PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC)  
- **Highlights:** Complex survey design handling, DHS variable recoding, survey-weighted regression analysis  
- **Repository:** https://github.com/addythedoc/sas-edhs-epidemiology-analysis  

### 2. Diabetes Readmission Prediction (R)
- **Focus:** 30-day hospital readmission among patients with diabetes  
- **Methods & Tools:** R (tidyverse, caret, pROC, randomForest)  
- **Highlights:** End-to-end analytical workflow including data cleaning, EDA, logistic regression, random forest modeling, and performance evaluation (ROC–AUC)
