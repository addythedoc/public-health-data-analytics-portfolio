# Influenza Vaccination Coverage Analysis (SQL & Tableau)

**Tools:** MySQL · SQL · Tableau  
**Domain:** Public Health Surveillance · Preventive Medicine  
**Data Source:** CDC FluVaxView (Influenza Vaccination Coverage – All Ages, 6+ Months)

---

## Project Overview
This project analyzes influenza vaccination coverage across U.S. states and evaluates progress toward the **Healthy People 70% vaccination target**.  
Using SQL-based aggregation and transformation, the analysis identifies geographic disparities and temporal trends, which are visualized through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

---

## Data
- CDC FluVaxView public-use dataset  
- Influenza vaccination coverage for all ages (6+ months)  
- State-level data across multiple influenza seasons  
- Public, aggregate-level data (no individual identifiers)

---

## Study Design & Methods
- Data ingestion and cleaning using **SQL (MySQL)**
- Creation of analytical tables with:
  - State-level vaccination coverage
  - Year-over-year trends
  - Comparison to Healthy People 70% benchmark
- Export of cleaned datasets for visualization
- Development of an interactive **Tableau dashboard**

---

## Key SQL Operations
- Filtering and aggregation using `GROUP BY`
- Calculation of vaccination coverage percentages
- Derivation of indicator variables for states below/above target
- Ordering and ranking states by coverage
- Preparation of visualization-ready datasets

---

## Key Insights
- Influenza vaccination coverage varies substantially across states
- Multiple states consistently fall below the **70% Healthy People target**
- Some states demonstrate gradual improvement over time, while others remain stagnant
- Geographic disparities highlight the need for targeted public health interventions

---

## Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard visualizes:
- State-level vaccination coverage
- Comparison to the 70% target
- Temporal vaccination trends

**Note:** GitHub cannot preview `.twbx` files.  
To view the dashboard:
1. Download the `.twbx` file from the `dashboard/` folder
2. Open using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public
